## 📚 Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction App leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the risk of diabetes. The model is trained on various health metrics, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.

### Key Features:
- Utilizes **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** for predictions
- Supports input of various health parameters like age, BMI, and glucose levels
- Provides risk assessment with a user-friendly interface
- Offers visualizations of prediction results

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-app.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-app
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to input patient data and receive predictions.

3. Adjust parameters such as age, BMI, and glucose levels for tailored results.

4. View and save the prediction results in the output/ folder.

## 📸 Sample Run

- **Input Data**: Health parameters entered by the user, such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure.

- **Prediction Result**: The model displays the likelihood of diabetes based on the provided input data.

### Example Input
| Parameter       | Value   |
|------------------|---------|
| Age              | 45      |
| BMI              | 28.5    |
| Glucose          | 150     |
| Blood Pressure    | 85      |

### Example Output
- **Predicted Probability of Diabetes**: 0.75 (indicating a 75% likelihood of diabetes)

## 🔬 Concepts Behind the Project

- **Feature Selection**: Identifying relevant health parameters that influence the risk of diabetes.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing historical data to train models capable of predicting diabetes risk based on input features.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
